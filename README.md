# ece-project
wireless controller based on Bluetooth technology using arduino
objectives -
automatic windows and door opening for physically impered people.
wireless locking system.

In this project, we have made a smart OTP-based locking system .
This smart lock can generate a new password every time you unlock it, which further enhances your security level.
This new device is much safer than the traditional key-based system and electronic wireless lock system. 
If you are still using the key-based system, you are likely to land in a big problem if your key gets lost or stolen. 
The electronic wireless lock system is not safe either. You might forget the password and there is also a high risk being hacked.
For your safety and security, we bring to you a DIY smart lock that has the capability to remove all these security threats and problems.
